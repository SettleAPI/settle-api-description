# Data Sharing (Permission Requests)

##### Knowing your customer and rewarding loyalty is essential to all modern businesses.

With strict consumer protection laws, hefty fines and customers being more cautious with their data, you can rely on Settle to help you build a GDPR compliant, data driven solution for your business to sell more. WIth Data Sharing you can request access to updated customer data and get it whenever you need it through an API. You can find a few use cases below.

## Rewarding a loyal customer

When a Customer visits the store, you would benefit if the Electronic Cash Registry (ECR) could recognize and relate the Customer to previous purchases, as well as make decisions on rewards such as awarding points, counting the number of coffees, issuing a discount or a free surprise.

### With Data Sharing you could use the following flow

1. When the Customer scans the QR code, the ECR may issue a Permission Request (this may be issued before, during or after payment).
2. The Customer has granted or grants the requested access.
3. The Permission Request returns the requested data points, which could be a loyalty ID placed and read by the ECR, so that the Customer may choose to be anonymous yet be rewarded for their loyalty to the Merchant, or it could be something as simple and recognizable as the Customer's phone number, email etc.
4. The ECR gets the data point and checks for the relevant data in your CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.
5. The ECR identifies that the Customer has previously bought 6 cups of coffee and that this cup of coffee is free (or whatever other reward procedure is implemented and relevant, including nudging the Customer to spend more to get a free gift etc).
6. The ECR updates the bill, discounting the coffee 100% and finalizes the sale.

For details on the payment part of the procedure, please refer to the [payments use cases](./ZG9jOjM0ODE0Nzg5-settle-at-checkout).

## Subscribing to a newsletter

When you need the email address of a Customer, you can collect it instantly without the issues of form typos: simply issue a Permission Request and ask your Customer for the email through Settle.

In a physical, digital, mobile or desktop environment, you can have the customer scan the QR or click the button, or even issue the request directly to their phone number if you have it on file.
