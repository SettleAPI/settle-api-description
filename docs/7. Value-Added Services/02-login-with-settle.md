# Login with Settle

Passwords should be a thing of the past, or at least having hundreds of them. With Settle you can offer your Customers the opportunity to log in with confidence, using their mobile phone. The login is considered a two factor authentication method, offering you and your Customer a high degree of confidence and trust. Still, it's super easy and requires minimum effort to integrate:

1. On your website, app or anywhere else you want to enable a login, you implement the `Login with Settle` button and QR Code.
2. When the Customer clicks this button (or scans the QR Code), the Settle App is launched and the Customer approves the login request, providing a secure two factor environment for the login and a GDPR compliant data sharing process.
3. You get the login data (`email`, `openID` or whichever [Scope](../merchant-api/c2NoOjU2Mjk2Nw-scope) you have decided to use for login) and can securely sign up or login the Customer.

> #### Note

> You can expand the login with additional data points to facilitate a more elaborate signup process than just asking for email.
